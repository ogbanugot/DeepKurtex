## Getting started  
First, Clone the repository and build the solution. 

## Building your own CNN model
Include the CNN module  
```sh
using AI.ML.CNN;
```
## Model configuration
Configuration can be achieved using either a configuration string or by initialization of the classes with their parameters passed to them.  
Configure with configuration string.

Check the test files in Tests/ for many use case examples. 

The framework is a work in progress, more classes and optimization to come.
